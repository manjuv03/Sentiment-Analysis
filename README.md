# Sentiment-Analysis

This is a Natural Language Processing Problem where Sentiment Analysis is done by Classifying the Positive tweets from negative tweets by machine learning models for classification,  text mining, text analysis, data analysis and data visualization

# Understand the Problem Statement

Let’s go through the problem statement once as it is very crucial to understand the objective before working on the dataset. The problem statement is as follows:
The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label ‘1’ denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label ‘0’ denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the given test dataset.

# Preprocessing and Cleaning
The preprocessing of the text data is an essential step as it makes the raw text ready for mining, i.e., it becomes easier to extract information from the text and apply machine learning algorithms to it. If we skip this step then there is a higher chance that you are working with noisy and inconsistent data. The objective of this step is to clean noise those are less relevant to find the sentiment of tweets such as punctuation, special characters, numbers, and terms which don’t carry much weightage in context to the text.

In one of the later stages, we will be extracting numeric features from our Twitter text data. This feature space is created using all the unique words present in the entire data. So, if we preprocess our data well, then we would be able to get a better quality feature space.

Let’s first read our data and load the necessary libraries.

# Visualization

In this section, we will explore the cleaned tweets text. Exploring and visualizing data, no matter whether its text or any other data, is an essential step in gaining insights. Do not limit yourself to only these methods told in this tutorial, feel free to explore the data as much as possible.

Before we begin exploration, we must think and ask questions related to the data in hand. A few probable questions are as follows:

What are the most common words in the entire dataset?
What are the most common words in the dataset for negative and positive tweets, respectively?
How many hashtags are there in a tweet?
Which trends are associated with my dataset?
Which trends are associated with either of the sentiments? Are they compatible with the sentiments?

# Conclusion

We learned how to approach a sentiment analysis problem. We started with preprocessing and exploration of data. Then we extracted features from the cleaned text using Bag-of-Words.
